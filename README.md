# Work-Day-Scheduler

This project is a daily schedule keeper to keep track of meetings.

## Description

This project allows the user to input important appointments and return to the page at a later date to review them. It tells the user the date at the top and indicates whether a given time block is past, present or future.

A key hurdle in creating this project was understanding how to target the necessary text area when a particular 'save' button was clicked.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this application, you can click on the text area for the given hour and type to add your appointment. Click the save button to the right of the text area and refresh the page, you will see the appointment remains in place. The date at the top of the page automatically updates and the colours of the time blocks change to indicate whether that hour has passed.
